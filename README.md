# Game Description

- Player 1 controls: WASD movement, SPACE to fire.
- Player 2 controls: Arrow key movement, ENTER to fire. 

Power Ups: 
- Green bullet power ups allow players to fire faster traveling bullets.
- Red life power up gives one additional life. Only two life power ups will spawn for the duration of the game.
